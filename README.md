# DDS3D
Dense Pseudo-Labels with Dynamic Threshold for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection(DDS3D).

You can find the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05079.

This is the repository for DDS3D(ICRA2023).
In this repository, we provide DDS3D implementation (with pytorch) based on PV-RCNN and 3DIoUMatch.
